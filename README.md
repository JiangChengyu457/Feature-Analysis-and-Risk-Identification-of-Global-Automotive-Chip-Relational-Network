# Feature-Analysis-and-Risk-Identification-of-Global-Automotive-Chip-Relational-Network

The background of this thesis is the automotive chip crisis that broke out in 2020. The dataset was built based on the stock price data of 42 leading companies in the chip industry from 2017 to 2021 for 5 years, establishes 5 chip correlation networks with DY spillover index matrix as the weight matrix and top companies as the model nodes and filtered. Network-level feature analysis is conducted for risk identification, including indicator coverage distribution, matching coefficient, average shortest path length, average clustering coefficient, and Louvain community discovery. Conclusion: The market distribution of the chip industry conforms to the Pareto law, with high market concentration and stable competitive landscape. The global division of labor in the industrial chain is significant, and the supply chain layout is concentrated and single, with a fragile "radiating" characteristic. The possibility of material flow or information exchange interruption is high. And based on this, countermeasures and suggestions were proposed.
